# AngularModule

This app is about demonstrating the basic building blocks on an Angular app. More precisely, I explored how modules share components (as directives and pipes) and services.

It consists of an app with 2 modules containing components which are shared only if you specify it and a service which is going to be shared globally.

This project (and modules, components and the service) was generated with Angular CLI.


## How to run it

* You may need to install Angular-CLI if it is not already globally installed.
* Run `npm install`to generate node_modules/.
* Run `ng serve` for a dev server.
* Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
